# The Embedding API

- AOT Embedding API
- JIT Embedding API

Both of the Embedding APIs reduce the amount of JavaScript that the browser compiles and runs by transporting data structures over the wire and executing binary bytecode stored a typed array.

This means that no matter how many templates an application uses, there is no additional JavaScript code for the browser to parse and compile.
